# Thoughter

This project was created for Iron Yard Students to practice Unit testing with
Karma, Mocha and Chai.

## How to use:

App uses grunt as a dev dependency. Grunt is configured to copy app js html and
scss files into build directory. Prior to copying js files are linted and tested
using js hint and karma.  

## To set up:

1. Fork directory from https://github.com/ElizabethBoles/thoughter
2. Run ```npm install``` in your terminal which downloads necessary app dependencies
and developer dependencies (jQuery, Grunt and Grunt task managers).
3. Run ```Grunt build``` to create build directory which then can be used to view app
in preferred browser.
